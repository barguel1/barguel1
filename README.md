## Hi there ğŸ‘‹
<p>
 ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a student at ASU working on a bachelors in web development.<br>
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning html5 and css. <br>
- I've learned the hardware side of computers but want to learn the website side of things now.>br>
- ğŸ˜„ My happy place when not working on projects is near the oceanğŸŒŠor a lake or natureğŸŒ²in general. <br>
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started taking apart and putting my first toy computer back together at 6 years old.
